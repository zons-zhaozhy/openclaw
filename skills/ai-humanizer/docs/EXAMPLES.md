## Example 4: Blog post intro

**Before (score: 45):**

> In today's rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, the landscape of machine learning continues to transform at an unprecedented pace. This groundbreaking technology has garnered significant attention from industry leaders and researchers alike, showcasing its potential to revolutionize various sectors.
>
> Furthermore, the multifaceted nature of deep learning encompasses a myriad of applications, from natural language processing to computer vision, highlighting the comprehensive scope of this transformative paradigm.

**After (score: 0):**

> Machine learning models got noticeably better in 2024. GPT-4o handles images and audio. Claude writes code that usually works on the first try. Stable Diffusion 3 makes hands that look right.
>
> The practical question isn't whether the technology works — it's whether it works well enough for your specific use case, and at what cost. A fine-tuned model for classifying support tickets costs a few hundred dollars and saves real time. A custom LLM to replace your writing staff probably doesn't.
